# Project-4-5-Data-collection-and-sharing
My dataset is a collection of survey answers gathered from my peers about their opinions on depression, anxiety, and overall mental health. They were asked 5 questions:

1. There is widespread mental health epidemics, problems such as depression and anxiety and many more. But WHY? In your opinion, what is the leading cause and what is the second-leading cause of this collective increase? For each of them can you briefly mention how that factor leads to a mental health problem?

2. What is your favorite thing about the modern human life, what is your second-favorite thing, and what is your least-favorite thing?

3. Name the biggest factor that, in your opinion, today, harms the mental health of mothers specifically.

4. Name the biggest factor that, in your opinion, today, harms the mental health of fathers specifically. 

and

5. Name the biggest factor that, in your opinion, today, harms the mental health of children specifically.

Through their responses, I was able to get an idea of my peers' perspective on mental health and the effects modern society has on the mental health on it's inhabitants.
